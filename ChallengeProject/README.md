# Challenge Project for Week 2 

Sleep data challenge from Massachusetts General Hospitalâ€™s (MGH), Computational Clinical Neurophysiology Laboratory (CCNL), and the Clinical Data Animation Laboratory (CDAC): https://www.physionet.org/physiobank/database/challenge/2018/

## Sleep_Analysis_Challenge
- Conatins a notebook with the challenge details fully explained. This challenge requires students to work with segments of signals from electroencephalography, electrooculography, electromyography, respiratory airflow, and electrocardiography. From these segments they must predict whether the patient was in an aroused (awake), in non-REM1, non-REM2, non-REM3, or REM state. 

## Preprocessing
- Contains code that was used to preprocess the data for this challenge

## Sleep_Analysis_Challenge_Eval_Script
- Script for evaluating challenge submissions from the students. Evaluation metrics include ROCAUC and MCC.

## TEST_LABELS
- Contains the ground truth labels for the test data. This is used only to evaluate the results of a model after it has been submitted by students. DO NOT MAKE THIS FILE PUBLIC.

## Student Presentations
- Conatins presentations students gave on their challenge solutions.
